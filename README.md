# Dungeon Master
Dungeon Master - Game Boy Advance(GBA) rogue like game written specially for [GBA Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22)


**[Warning]** Recently we changed compiler and overall approach, now we will use devkitadv, look **Setup** section for more information.
There's not a lot documentation about **devkitadv**, and overall looking at new approach it is more low level, but its fine cause we will have more controls on hardware. For more practice I suggest watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ecgELrwAnQ&t=387s) , or look on this [repository](https://github.com/3DSage/GBA_Mode_5_Starter) (as I think pretty good example of devkitadv based project)
